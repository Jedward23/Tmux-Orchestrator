# Security Validation Checklist

## Pre-Commit Security Checklist

Run this checklist before every commit to ensure no sensitive data is accidentally committed:

### 🔍 Automated Checks
- [ ] Run `./scripts/security-scan.sh --pre-commit` and verify it passes
- [ ] Check git status for any untracked sensitive files
- [ ] Verify no files with extensions: `.key`, `.pem`, `.p12`, `.pfx`, `.crt`, `.cer`, `.der`

### 🔐 Manual Review
- [ ] No hardcoded passwords or API keys in code
- [ ] No personal configuration files (.claude.json, .config/, etc.)
- [ ] No credentials or authentication tokens in plain text
- [ ] No private keys, certificates, or cryptographic materials
- [ ] No database connection strings with credentials
- [ ] No debugging code that might expose sensitive information
- [ ] Environment variables used for all sensitive configuration
- [ ] All secrets use proper environment variable references (e.g., `$API_KEY`, not actual values)

### 📁 File Validation
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated if new file types introduced
- [ ] All sensitive files properly ignored by git
- [ ] No personal directories or system-specific files
- [ ] No log files containing sensitive information
- [ ] No backup files with sensitive data

## Weekly Security Audit

Perform these checks weekly to maintain security posture:

### 🔍 Comprehensive Scan
- [ ] Run `./scripts/security-scan.sh --full-scan` and review results
- [ ] Check git history for accidental commits: `git log --oneline -20`
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` coverage is comprehensive
- [ ] Review file permissions for any sensitive files

### 🔐 Access Control
- [ ] Verify repository permissions are correctly set
- [ ] Review who has access to the repository
- [ ] Check for any unauthorized changes or commits
- [ ] Validate all team members are using proper authentication

### 📊 Security Metrics
- [ ] Review security scan logs for trends
- [ ] Check for any repeated security issues
- [ ] Validate security training effectiveness
- [ ] Document any security incidents or near-misses

## Monthly Security Review

Comprehensive security review for the project:

### 🔍 Deep Analysis
- [ ] Full codebase security audit
- [ ] Review all dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Check for any new security best practices
- [ ] Validate incident response procedures

### 🔐 Policy Review
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` with new patterns if needed
- [ ] Review access controls and permissions
- [ ] Validate backup and recovery procedures

### 📈 Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Update security scanning tools
- [ ] Review and improve security documentation
- [ ] Implement any new security measures
- [ ] Schedule security training updates

## Security Incident Response

If sensitive data is accidentally committed:

### 🚨 Immediate Actions (within 1 hour)
1. **Stop all operations** and assess the scope
2. **Revoke/rotate all exposed credentials** immediately
3. **Document the incident** with timestamps and scope
4. **Notify team members** about the security incident
5. **Remove sensitive data** from the repository

### 🔧 Repository Cleanup (within 24 hours)
1. **Remove from working directory**: `git rm <sensitive-file>`
2. **Remove from git history**: Use `git filter-repo` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
3. **Force push changes**: `git push --force-with-lease`
4. **Verify cleanup**: Run full security scan to confirm removal
5. **Update `.gitignore`**: Add patterns to prevent recurrence

### 📋 Follow-up Actions (within 1 week)
1. **Audit all commits** for similar issues
2. **Review and update security procedures**
3. **Implement additional prevention measures**
4. **Schedule security training** for team members
5. **Document lessons learned** and update procedures

## Security Tool Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
Set up automatic security scanning with git hooks:

```bash
# Create pre-commit hook
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
exec ./scripts/security-scan.sh --pre-commit
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### CI/CD Integration
Add security scanning to continuous integration:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Security Scan
        run: ./scripts/security-scan.sh --full-scan
```

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Set up automated security scanning schedules
- Configure alerts for security policy violations
- Monitor for unusual file changes or access patterns
- Track security metrics and trends over time
